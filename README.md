# Ultra Light Wi-Fi Interface Firmware - ULWI

**This firmware is in ALPHA and is incomplete**

The ULWI firmware aims to convert the original AT command line interface of the ESP8266 into an extremely lightweight and robust command-reply style interface, with a command set inspired by assembly mnemonics. 

This firmware is developed for devices that intend to interface to the ESP8266 in a master-slave configuration, whereas the device in question acts as the master while the ESP8266 acts as the slave. 

This firmware is designed to be optimised for the SPEEEduino and SSTuino family of Arduino-ESP8266 hybrid boards, with a 9600/8-N-1 software serial link connecting the ATmega328 with the ESP8266, with an ATmega328P acting as the master to the ESP8266.

## Deficiencies of the AT command interface and how to fix them
The original AT command interface or firmware used by many ESP8266 modules has many issues and we aim to mitigate them as much as possible in this firmware:

### Overly long commands
**Problem**: Commands in the original AT command interface are too long, requiring many bytes to store, load and manipulate them in a limited microcontroller like the ATmega328P. This is completely unnecessary and can be greatly shortened.

**Solution**: Use very short 3 to 5 character assembly mnemonic style commands, such as changing `AT+CWJAP_DEF` to something like `CAP` (**C**onnect to **A**ccess **P**oint).

### Eliminating synchronous/blocking commands
**Problem**: Many commands in the AT command interface are "blocking" or synchronous, meaning that they require the master to stop and wait for a reply while the ESP8266 performs a long-running task that is asynchronous in nature, such as connecting to an access point or initiating a TCP request. 

**Solution**: Shorten the execution time of all commands by immediately replying the master and restructure the masterâ€™s code to be a polling architecture. For example, instead of waiting for a TCP request to finish, we can initiate the TCP request first, do other things, and issue a periodic command to the ESP8266 to check if the TCP command has finished.

## Basic environment setup
Make sure that you have cloned the [Mongoose OS Git repository](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose-os) to your computer to allow IntelliSense to detect the headers. The repository should be placed in `${workspaceFolder}/../mongoose-os`.

For optimal experience, install the Mongoose OS IDE extension in Visual Studio Code to configure the default serial port without having to manually set environment variables.
